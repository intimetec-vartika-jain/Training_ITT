                     REST API in Powershell
 

REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) in a powershell uses HTTP requests to read,creat,add,delete and manipulate data.

HTTP method that are used to do in a REST API :
GET: read 
POST: create
PUT: update
DELETE: remove

The data returned by a REST API is usually returned in JSON format.

The Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet sends HTTP and HTTPS requests to REST web services that return richly structured data.
this cmdlets allows to send HTTP request and handle the responses.

1. GET Request.
The GET method is used to access data for a specific resource from a REST API

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "url that you want " -Method Get

2. POST Request.
The POST method is used for creating objects like users, entries, and more. The POST request sends a body with information to the REST endpoint, normally in JSON format, or in a URL-encoded form. 
example: 

$Cred = Get-Credential
$Url = "https://server.contoso.com:8089/services/search/jobs/export"
$Body = @{
    search = "search index=_internal | reverse | table index,host,source,sourcetype,_raw"
    output_mode = "csv"
    earliest_time = "-2d@d"
    latest_time = "-1d@d"
}
Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $url -Credential $Cred -Body $body -OutFile output.csv


3.PUT Request.
The PUT method updates already existing data. This is done similarly to the POST method.

$body = @{
    key1 = "new value"
} | ConvertTo-Json

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.example.com/resource" -Method Put -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"


4.DELETE Request.
The DELETE method deletes data

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.example.com/resource" -Method Delete
