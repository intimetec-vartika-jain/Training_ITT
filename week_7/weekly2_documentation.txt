**Create a document highlighting the differences between minikube and AKS

-Minikube
Overview:
Minikube is a local Kubernetes cluster management tool designed for development and testing purposes. It enables users to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on their local machines, making it ideal for exploring Kubernetes features, testing applications, and learning Kubernetes concepts.

Key Features:
Local Deployment: Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on a local machine using a virtualization tool like VirtualBox, VMware, or KVM.

Simplicity: It is easy to install and set up, making it suitable for developers who want a quick way to experiment with Kubernetes.

Learning Environment: Minikube is often used as a learning tool for those new to Kubernetes, allowing them to understand how to deploy, manage, and scale applications.

Limited Scalability: Due to its single-node nature, Minikube is not suitable for testing scenarios that require multi-node configurations or larger scale deployments.

Resource Consumption: Minikube consumes fewer resources compared to cloud-based solutions like AKS.

-Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Overview:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure. It is designed for production-grade workloads and offers a managed Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.

Key Features:
Managed Service: AKS provides a managed Kubernetes environment, handling the operational aspects such as updates, scaling, and monitoring, allowing developers to focus on their applications.

Scalability: AKS supports the creation of multi-node clusters, making it suitable for deploying large-scale applications and microservices.

Integration with Azure Services: AKS seamlessly integrates with other Azure services like Azure Active Directory, Azure Monitor, and Azure Policy.

Advanced Networking and Security: AKS provides advanced networking features, including integration with Azure Virtual Networks and network policies, enhancing security and isolation.

Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments: AKS allows for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios, enabling deployment across on-premises and multiple cloud environments.

Auto Scaling: AKS supports automatic scaling based on demand, helping to ensure optimal resource utilization.

Choosing Between Minikube and AKS:
When deciding whether to use Minikube or AKS, consider the following factors:

Use Case: If you are new to Kubernetes and want to learn and experiment with its features, Minikube is a good choice. For production-grade workloads, AKS is more suitable.

Scalability: If your application needs to handle a large number of containers or demands a multi-node cluster, AKS provides the scalability required.

Managed vs. Self-Managed: AKS offers a managed environment, whereas Minikube requires more manual setup and management.

Resource Availability: If you have limited resources on your local machine, Minikube's lightweight nature may be preferable.

Integration with Cloud Services: If your application relies on Azure services, AKS offers seamless integration.

In summary, Minikube is a valuable tool for learning and local development, while AKS is a robust managed Kubernetes service for production workloads with features designed for scalability, integration, and automation.

**Create a document with basic kubectl commands

Basic kubectl Commands

Here are some fundamental kubectl commands for interacting with Kubernetes clusters:

Create Resources:
kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<image>: Create a deployment using a specified image.
kubectl create service <type> <name> --tcp=<port>:<targetPort>: Create a service to expose a deployment.

View and Debug:
kubectl get pods: List all pods in the current namespace.
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>: View detailed information about a specific pod.
kubectl logs <pod-name>: View logs from a specific pod.

Scale and Update:
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<count>: Scale the number of replicas for a deployment.
kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <container-name>=<new-image>: Update a deployment's container image.

Networking:
kubectl get services: List all services in the current namespace.
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:<pod-port>: Forward a local port to a port on a specific pod.

Delete Resources:
kubectl delete deployment <name>: Delete a deployment.
kubectl delete service <name>: Delete a service.
kubectl delete pod <pod-name>: Delete a specific pod.

Namespace Management:
kubectl get namespaces: List all namespaces.
kubectl create namespace <name>: Create a new namespace.
kubectl delete namespace <name>: Delete a namespace.

Context and Configuration:
kubectl config get-contexts: List available contexts (clusters, users, namespaces).
kubectl config use-context <context-name>: Switch to a different context.

Apply Configuration:
kubectl apply -f <yaml-file>: Apply configuration from a YAML file.
kubectl apply -f <directory>: Apply configuration from all YAML files in a directory.
