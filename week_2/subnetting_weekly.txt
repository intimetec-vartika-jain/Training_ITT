Address Block: 192.168.0.0/16
Subnetting need to be implemented for assigning network to 5 different projects


* We have 16 netmask this show that 16 bits belong to network portion and 16 belongs to host portion 

 In order to make 5 subnet we need to borrow 3 bits from host portion 
 
 new subnet mask 16+3 = 19

Now, with /19 bit subnet mask we have 13 bit in the host portion. this provide 2^13 = 8192 host address per subnet

to divide the address block into 5 subnet range is as follow:

subnet 1:- 192.168.0.0/19 
usage ip - 192.168.0.1/19 - 192.168.31.254/19  

subnet 2:- 192.168.32.0/19 
usage ip - 192.168.32.1/19 - 192.168.63.254/19 

subnet 3:- 192.168.64.0/19 
usage ip - 192.168.64.1/19 - 192.168.95.254/19 

subnet 4:- 192.168.96.0/19 
usage ip - 192.168.96.1/19 - 192.168.127.254/19 

subnet 5:- 192.168.128.0/19 
usage ip - 192.168.128.1/19 - 192.168.159.254/19
