1) Subnet the Class C IP Address 205.11.2.0 so that you have 30 subnets. What is the subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts? How many hosts can each subnet have? What is the IP address of host 3 on subnet 2? 

* To subnet the class C ip 205.11.2.0 into 30 subnet we need to borrow additional bits from host portion by using formula 
        2^n >= no of subnet
        2^5 >= 30
     n = 5  
  so, need to borrow 5 bits form host portion 
 
The subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts can be calculated using the formula: 2^(number of host bits) - 2. The "-2" is subtracted to account for the network address and the broadcast address.
In this case, we have borrowed 5 bits for subnetting, so the number of host bits remaining is 8 - 5 = 3.

The subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts will be: 255.255.255.224.

* To calculate the number of hosts per subnet, we can use the formula: 2^(number of host bits) - 2. Again, the "-2" is subtracted to account for the network address and the broadcast address.
        2^3-2 = 6


* Subnet 2 falls into the third subnet range, starting from 0. Therefore, the subnet ID for subnet 2 would be:

   205.11.2.0

Since we need to find the IP address of host 3, we can simply add 3 to the subnet ID:

  205.11.2.3


conclusion 

Subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts: 255.255.255.224
Number of hosts per subnet: 6
IP address of host 3 on subnet 2: 205.11.2.3
